It states that given a population with mean Î¼ and standard deviation Ïƒ, the sampling distribution of sample means will approach a normal distribution with mean Î¼ and standard deviation Ïƒ/âˆšn as the sample size n increases. For example, if we repeatedly take samples of size 30 from any population and calculate their means, these sample means will be approximately normally distributed regardless of the original population's distribution.",

For example, [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0] creates a list of squares of even numbers from 0 to 8, resulting in [0, 4, 16, 36, 64].

In machine learning, it's commonly used to minimize cost functions. The algorithm works by calculating the gradient (partial derivatives) of the cost function with respect to parameters, then updating parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient. The learning rate Î± controls the step size: Î¸ = Î¸ - Î±âˆ‡J(Î¸). For example, in linear regression, we use gradient descent to find optimal weights that minimize mean squared error.",

The STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) is the best framework for answering these questions. For example, when asked 'Tell me about a time you overcame a challenge,' you should describe the Situation (context), Task (what needed to be done), Action (steps you took), and Result (outcome and learnings). Common behavioral questions focus on leadership, teamwork, problem-solving, and conflict resolution.",

Basic workflow: 'git init' creates a repo, 'git add' stages changes, 'git commit' saves changes, 'git push' uploads to remote repo, 'git pull' downloads changes.
