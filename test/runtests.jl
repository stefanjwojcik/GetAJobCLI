It states that given a population with mean Î¼ and standard deviation Ïƒ, the sampling distribution of sample means will approach a normal distribution with mean Î¼ and standard deviation Ïƒ/âˆšn as the sample size n increases. For example, if we repeatedly take samples of size 30 from any population and calculate their means, these sample means will be approximately normally distributed regardless of the original population's distribution.",

In machine learning, it's commonly used to minimize cost functions. The algorithm works by calculating the gradient (partial derivatives) of the cost function with respect to parameters, then updating parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient. The learning rate Î± controls the step size: Î¸ = Î¸ - Î±âˆ‡J(Î¸). For example, in linear regression, we use gradient descent to find optimal weights that minimize mean squared error.",
