# GetAJobCLI

This uses a bunch of files and extracts useful information from them. However, since they are from someone's study sessions, names are mentioned that we need to remove. 

For Posterity: 
- I moved all non-monograph files with personal information to its own folder 
- I opened each of those files and removed names, replacing them with "Person" or something else 
- I searched and replaced most company names with "Company" or some moniker that gives the gist of the company without revealing its identity.

TODO: 
[] # - Remove names from certain personal files and replace with "Person" 
[]: # - Remove specific company names and replace with "Company" 
[]: # - Extract useful information from the files
[]: # - Save the extracted information to a file
